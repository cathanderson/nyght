## Background and Overview

Nyght is a New York City plan generator fit for couples looking for new date ideas and groups of friends looking for new places to try in different neighborhoods across the city.

To create a plan, the user can navigate to the home page, select a neighborhood, whether they'd prefer an after dinner cocktail or dessert, and modify the provided plan by clicking a venue and toggling through available options in that category.

Once the user is satisfied with their plan, they can hit confirm. This will bring them to the itinerary's page which includes a map for their plan and functionality to email their plan to themself and their friends. They also have the ability to modify/cancel their plan from that page.
